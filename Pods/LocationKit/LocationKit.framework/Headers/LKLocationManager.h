 * delegate
 *
 * Discussion:
 *     An object implementing he CLLocationManagerDelegate protocol. We highly suggest switching
 *     over to using advancedDelegate to get all of the power of LocationKit, though we will call
 *     the relevant methods in this delegate, if provided, with our enhanced features to the best
 *     of our ability though of course some fidelity will be lost.

 * debug
 *
 * Discussion:

 *     to the console. Intended for development purposes only, we suggest setting this during
 *     development but not deploying production code with it enabled.
 */

/*
 * deviceId
 *
 * Discussion:
 *     The unique identifier for this user's device. If your app is using the AdSupport natively we
 *     will use the advertising identifier (IDFA). If not, we will generate a random UUID, assign
 *     that to this device, and use it as long as they keep the app installed. If they re-install
 *     the app they will get a new deviceId (as the data store we write it to will be wiped on an
 *     app uninstall/install)

 * apiToken
 *

 *
 *     Required to run LocationKit

@property(nonatomic, strong) NSString* _Nullable apiToken;

/*
 * locationUpdateInterval
 *
 * Discussion:
 *     If provided, location updates will be provided on an interval. Note, the smaller the
 *     interval, the more frequently your code will run and the more noticeable effect it will
 *     have on the battery life of the device so while we support an interval as small as 1
 *     second, we suggest keeping the interval at 1 minute or more.

/*
 * whenInUseOnly
 *
 * Discussion:
 *     Whether or not to run LocationKit in "whenInUse" mode, basically a mode requiring only
 *     "whenInUse" permissions.
 *
 *     When this flag is enabled, LocationKit will prompt only for whenInUse privileges when
 *     it attempts to start monitoring the user's location. For ease and simplicity of most use
 *     cases, this value is disabled by default, so LocationKit will prompt for "always" location
 *     permissions by default.
 *
 *     Notes:
 *       (1) This must be called prior to starting location updates in order to be effective
 *       (2) This requires you to have the key `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` set in your
 *           Info.plist to the text you'll display describing your intent/rationale for wanting
 *           their location. Our default getting started guide only mentions the
 *           `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` since that is the default for LocationKit.

@property(nonatomic) BOOL whenInUseOnly;

/*
 * useCMMotionActivityManager
 *
 * Discussion:
 *     Whether or not to use the motion co-processor on board the device for the activity mode
 *     changes. Doing so will generally provide better battery life, but your users will have
 *     to respond to another iOS system dialog (requesting permission to have their activity data)
 *     if your app does not already have that permission.
 *
 *     Since most apps prefer not to have an additional iOS system prompt, this feature is disabled
 *     by default and must be enabled prior to starting Visit monitoring in order for it to be effective.

/*
 * searchForPlacesWithRequest
 *
 * Discussion:

 *     automatically send along the current place of the device, find all places which match
 *     your search request around that device, and send them back.

- (void)searchForPlacesWithRequest:(LKSearchRequest* _Nonnull)request completionHandler:(void (^ _Nonnull)(NSArray<LKPlacemark *>* _Nullable places, NSError* _Nullable error))handler;

/*

 *     Request the LKPlacemark for an arbitrary location of your choosing. Essentially beefed up reverse
 *     geocoding into which you supply an arbitrary location (as a CLLocation object) and we will match
 *     that location with everything we know about it in the proprietary LocationKit database, including
 *     the address, any venues at that location, events happening at that location, and so on.

/*
 * requestHomeAddress
 *
 * Discussion:
 *     Based on the visit history of this device, LocationKit can analyze that visit history and
 *     provide a pretty good guess at this device user's home address. Note, it can take some time
 *     to gather enough history to be able to reasonably know the user's address so this may be
 *     nil for some time. And even beyond that it is just a best guess. So if your user happened
 *     to be on vacation for a week when they install your app, this method may report their hotel
 *     as their home address. Only once they return home and gather enough data to indicate that
 *     their actual home is their home will we start reporting that as their home, so this value
 *     is not guaranteed to be static either.

 *
 * Discussion:
 *     Based on the visit history of this device, LocationKit can analyze that visit history and
 *     provide a pretty good guess at this device user's work address. Just as with
 *     requestHomeAddress, this method will also have to gather a decent sample of data before it
 *     can take a reasonable guess at a work address so it may be nil for some time

/*
 * startMonitoringVisits
 *
 * Discussion:
 *     By default, visit detection is disabled for optimal battery life. To enable it, call this
 *     method and not only will LocationKit go into a mode optimized for best battery life with
 *     maximum visit detection accuracy, but your LKLocationManagerDelegate methods `didStartVisit`
 *     and `didEndVisit` will get called whenever a visit is started or ended.

- (void)startMonitoringVisits;

/*
 * stopMonitoringVisits
 *
 * Discussion:
 *     By default, visit detection is disabled for optimal battery life. To disable it once it has
 *     been enabled, call this method and LocationKit will stop monitoring for visits and go back
 *     to the settings it had prior to starting visit monitoring.

/*

 *
 *  Discussion:
 *      Update user values. Use LKUserValue constants as dictionary keys. These values are all
 *      optional but can be used for segmenting your data on the LocationKit dashboard, for

/*

 *     and any other place this particular device has data.
